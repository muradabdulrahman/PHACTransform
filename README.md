# PHACTransform
CS-512 Deep Learning class project


## Here we aim to keep the progress in an organized way so all of us can follow and collaborate. 


## Workflow

1. Data Prep: We are using only phact-related measures. Everything is ready, we just need to integrate.
2. The target variable is to be normalized within each dataset.

The important thing is to understand the transformer arch and how we are employing it. So, let's all try out best to understand transformers. 
3. it might be applicalble to use ESM which is a protein L model that take the WT seq and the Mutated seq and derive some important features. https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm
4. We need to decide on a proper arch to use. (Model design)
5. Do initial training..
