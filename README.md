# PHACTransform
CS-515 Deep Learning class project


## Here we aim to keep the progress in an organized way so all of us can follow and collaborate. 


## Workflow

1. Data Prep: We are using only phact-related measures. Everything is ready, we just need to integrate.
2. The target variable is to be normalized within each dataset.

        `The important thing is to understand the transformer arch and how we are employing it. So, let's all try out best to understand transformers`
3. it might be applicalble to use ESM which is a protein L model that take the WT seq and the Mutated seq and derives some important features. https://github.com/facebookresearch/esm ❗ (priority)
4. We need to decide on a proper arch to use. (Model design)
5. Do initial training..

| Step          | Description                                                                   | Time Needed | Deadline     |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| Data Prep     | Integration of phact-related measures into the dataset.                       |  1 day      |             |
| Transformer Understanding | Everyone familiarizes themselves with transformer architecture.        | 1 day | ❗      |
| ESM Integration | Explore and implement ESM for feature extraction from protein sequences.   | 1 day     | ❗      |
| Model Design  | Decide on an appropriate architecture for the model.                          | 2 days      | -            |
| Initial Training | Perform initial training of the model.                                        | ..       | -            |
